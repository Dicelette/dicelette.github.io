- A maximum of 20 statistics is supported.
- Only 25 "registered" dice (including templates and personal dice) are supported.
- It is not possible to modify statistics if they do not exist in the original template.
- Sometimes, it is necessary to manually update sheets if the template is modified. Additionally, in some cases, sheets must be entirely re-registered.
