First, you need to **generate** a new template. To do this, use the command `/register`, followed by the name of the template. More over, you can generate a server template with the following command: `/generate`.

This command will allow you to create a new `JSON` file, with the following (optional) parameters:
- `name`: The name of the statistics to be separated by a space or a comma. If any of the statistics contain a space, you must surround it with quotation marks. For example: `"Intelligence Logic", Strength, Dexterity`.
- `die`: The type of dice to roll, which can contain a formula (see [#dice](#dice)).
- `total`: If, when creating, your players have a number of points to distribute. Unfortunately, it is not possible to set conditions for this total (for example, depending on the character's age, they will have only 60 points, while an older character will have 70). In these cases, it is better to choose the highest value and check manually.
- `character`: You can make entering a character name mandatory with this option.
- `critical_success`: In natural dice rolls, if a die falls on this value, it is considered a critical success.
- `critical_failure`: In natural dice rolls, if a die falls on this value, it is considered a critical failure.
- `skill`: Allows defining (when the template is edited before saving) the addition of fields for skill (or attack) dice. Like the name, you must separate the values with a comma.

For template examples, you can consult the `template` files [here](https://github.com/Dicelette/discord-dicelette/tree/main/template) or [here](register/template).

:::info
Statistics and dice are optional:
- The absence of statistics will prevent the use of the `/dbroll` command, and you will not be able to save statistics on the sheets. If you save statistics after creating users, you will need to recreate the sheets.
- The absence of dice (either in templates or sheets) will prevent the use of `/dbd`.
:::

## Dice

There are two types of dice:
- The die that will be rolled by the `dbroll` command, which we will call **die type**.
- The dice saved for the `dbd` command, which we will call **saved dice**.

Both types of dice must follow the syntax of the [dice-roller API](https://dice-roller.github.io/documentation/), and can support various mathematical formulas.

In both cases, you can use the syntax `{{` and `}}` to write complex mathematical formulas, such as `ceil`, `floor`, `round`, etc. However, if you want to "target" a statistic, the syntax will be different depending on what you are using:
- Die types target only the syntax used in the `dbroll` command. The sign to indicate a statistic is `$`.
- Saved dice target the syntax used in the `dbd` command. Since you have access to all statistics, you can target them directly with their name.

:::tip[Example]
- For a die type: `1d6>$` or `1d6+$`
- For a saved die: `1d6 > Strength` or `1d6 + Strength`

For a die based on a formula:
- For a die type: `1d6 + {{ceil($ / 2)}}`
- For a saved die: `1d6 + {{ceil(Strength / 2)}}`

It is also possible to compare with a formula:
- For a die type: `1d6 > {{ceil($ / 2)}}`
- For a saved die: `1d6 > {{ceil(Strength / 2)}}`

## Statistics

Statistics are based on a name, but you will notice that after generating the file, each statistic will have three fields:
- `min`: The minimum value the statistic can have.
- `max`: The maximum value the statistic can have.
- `combination`: If the statistic is a combination of several other statistics, you can indicate it here. For example, if the `Dodge` statistic is the sum of `Strength` and `Dexterity`, you can indicate it here. Using a combination automatically cancels out the `min` and `max` values. Additionally, combined statistics will not be calculated in the total sum.

## What's Next?

Once the template has been created and you are satisfied with it, you can use the command `/register <channel> <file>`. You must choose:
- The channel where the embed will be pinned (and where the button will be available).
- The file to be used as a template.
- (Optional) The channel where the character sheet will be posted. If this parameter is omitted, the character sheet will be posted in a thread created from the channel where the button was posted, named `üìù - [STATS]`. 

:::tip
If you want to allow your players to edit their own sheet, you can choose a channel they have access to. Otherwise, simply choose a private channel.
:::

For practical reasons, the embed will be pinned.

:::warning
It is not possible to change the channel of publication for cards in the future while retaining the old cards. The old cards will not be found during searches because the channel is saved globally, rather than specific to each card.
