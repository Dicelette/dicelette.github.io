title: Limitation
---

Here are the limitations to consider when registering and editing models and sheets:

- A maximum of 20 statistics is supported.
- Only 25 dice can be "saved" (including models and personal dice) at most.
- It is not possible to modify statistics if they do not exist in the original model.
- Sometimes, it is necessary to manually update sheets if the model is modified. Additionally, in some cases, sheets must be entirely re-registered.
- When editing a sheet, statistics are not checked against the total or a maximum. Moreover, it is impossible to control the number of points spent per statistic in systems where spending 1 point in a statistic is not equivalent to 1 statistic point.
