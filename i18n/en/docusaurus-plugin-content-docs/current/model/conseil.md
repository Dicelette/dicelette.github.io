- Avoid saving all dice in the server template, especially if their number is significant. Each user is subject to a complete limitation (only 25 dice can be saved). It's preferable to specifically save, per player, only the dice they have access to, such as the weapons they use or their skills. For example, it's not necessary for an archer to have access to all combat dice, but only to those related to their bow.

- Sheets are not designed to receive temporary bonuses and penalties or equipment, which should instead be used directly in the `/dbroll` command. The bot does not yet support equipment, and you cannot create "bonus" or "penalty" columns for each statistic. However, it is possible to modify the values of the saved statistics as needed, especially in the case of point distribution after gaining a level.
