## Dice Rolling

Two commands are available for rolling dice, with auto-completion functionality to simplify input for statistics, character names, and dice names.

### DBRoll (`/dbroll`)

:::info
The `dbroll` command is used to roll dice for previously registered statistics, avoiding the need to remember a character's basic attributes.
:::

The command requires specifying:
- The statistic
- The character's name
- Any modifiers (such as advantage or disadvantage)
- Replacing the success value (e.g., for a difficult roll), with indication of the comparison (example: >= 10)
- Any comment on your action

### DBD (`/dbd`)

:::info
The `dbd` command allows rolling a saved die.
:::

This command requires:
- The skill
- The character's name
- Any modifiers
- Any comment on your action

## Logs

The `logs` command allows configuring a channel to:
- Report all errors,
- Record any modifications made to a character.

## Display

The `display` command allows viewing the statistics and dice of a character saved in the database. It will ask for:
- The player
- And/or the character's name

Combining both allows selecting a specific player's character (which can be useful in case of duplicate character names, although this is unlikely).

## Graph (`/graph`)

The `/graph` command is a "gimmick" feature that generates a graph from a character's statistics. It requires:
- The player's name
- And/or the character's name.

As before, you can combine both options to select a specific character from a player.

Optionally, you can also specify colors with:
- `line`: For lines (default is `#0e47b2`).
- `background`: For the background (default is `#0e47b2`).

Colors can be in hexadecimal or RGB. For example, `#FF0000` or `255,0,0`.

Finally, you can define a minimum and maximum for the axes with `min` and `max`.

By default:
- The minimum is calculated according to the server template (if existing).
- The maximum is determined differently:
   - If a maximum is defined by the template, it will be used.
   - Otherwise, it will be based on the critical success value.
   - If neither of the above options is available, it will be based on the die value (e.g., if `1d20`, the value will be 20).
   - As a last resort, it will be automatically calculated based on the user's statistics.
