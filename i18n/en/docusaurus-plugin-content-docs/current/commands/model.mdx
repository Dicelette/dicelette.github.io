## Dice Rolling

### DBRoll (`/dbroll`)

:::info
The `dbroll` command is used to roll dice for statistics that have been previously recorded, allowing you to avoid remembering the basic characteristics of a character.
:::

The command requires specifying:
- The statistic
- The character's name
- Any modifiers (such as advantage or disadvantage)
- Replacement of the success value (e.g., for a difficult roll), with indication of comparison (e.g., >= 10)
- Any comments on your action

:::info
The `dbd` command allows rolling a registered die.
:::

This command requires:
- The skill
- The character's name
- Any modifiers
- Any comments on your action

## Others
### Display

The `display` command allows you to view the statistics and dice of a character recorded in the database. It will ask for:
- The player
- And/or the character's name

Combining both allows you to select a specific character of a specific player (which can be useful in case of duplicate character names, although this is unlikely).

### Graph (`/graph`)

The `/graph` command is a "gimmick" feature that generates a graph from a character's statistics. It requires:
- The player's name
- And/or the character's name.

As before, you can combine both options to select a specific character of a player.

Optionally, you can also specify colors with:
- `line`: For lines (default, `#0e47b2`).
- `background`: For background (default, `#0e47b2`).

Colors can be in hexadecimal or RGB. For example, `#FF0000` or `255,0,0`.

Finally, you can set a minimum and maximum for the axes with `min` and `max`.

By default:
- The minimum is calculated according to the server template (if existing).
- The maximum is determined in different ways:
   - If a maximum is defined by the template, it will be used.
   - Otherwise, it will be based on the critical success value.
   - If neither of the two previous options is available, it will be based on the die value (for example, if `1d20`, the value will be 20).
   - As a last resort, it will be automatically calculated based on the user's statistics.
