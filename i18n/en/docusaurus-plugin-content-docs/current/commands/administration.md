The following commands are restricted by default to members with the `Manage Roles` permission.

## General
### Logs

:::usage
**`/logs (#channel)`**
:::

The `logs` command allows you to set up a channel to:
- Report all errors,
- Log any changes made to a character.

Sending the command without the `#channel` argument will remove logging.

### Changing the Results Channel (`/result_channel`)

:::usage
**`/result_channel (#channel)`**
:::

The `/result_channel` command sets a channel to receive dice roll results instead of using a thread each time. The channel ID will then be stored in the database similarly to the `logs` command.

Sending the command without the "channel" argument will remove the results channel, similar to the `logs` command.

### Disable Thread Auto-Creation

:::usage
**`/disable_threads [true/false]`**
:::

If the option is set to **true**, it disables the default creation of threads for dice rolls. Everything will be sent (without deletion) to the channel where the command was executed.

It also disables sending to the channel configured by the `/result_channel` command, if any.

Channels and threads prefixed with `ðŸŽ²` will no longer receive logs either.

Setting the option to **false** reactivates the bot's normal behavior.

## Character Sheet and Template

### Delete a Character/Player (`/delete_char`)

:::usage
**`/delete_char [@player] (*character)`**
:::

The `delete_char` command removes a character or player from the database. 

It requires:
- `[@player]` - The player's name
- `(*character)` - And/or the character's name, based on the selected user.

If no character name is provided, it will delete all data for the player. If you wish to delete only the "unnamed character" of a player, you can do so by selecting "default" from the character name list.

### Auto-Role (`/auto_role`)

:::usage
- **`/auto_role dÃ© (@role)`**
- **`/auto_role stats (@role)`**
:::

These commands allow automatically adding roles when:
- A die is rolled (`/auto_role die`)
- Statistics are validated (`/auto_role stats`)

This notably enables the use of `/dbd` and `/dbroll` for users who actually have permission to use these two commands.

If the role is not provided, the option will be disabled.

## Game Master Dice Rolls

:::info
The two following commands allow game masters to roll dice for any registered players.
:::

:::usage
- **`/gm dbroll (@player) [statistic] (*character)`**
- **`/gm dbd (@player) (*dice name) (*character)`**
:::

Both commands are similar to [dbroll](./model#dbroll-dbroll) and [dbd](./model#dbd-dbd), but additionally require specification of the player for whom the roll is being made. As with the other commands, you can choose a character belonging to this player or leave the default choice.
