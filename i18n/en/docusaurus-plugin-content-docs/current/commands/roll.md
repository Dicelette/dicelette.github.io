## Dice Rolling

Use `/roll <argument>` to roll a die. You can also use the "semi-direct" notation by adding a comment: `/roll <argument> My comment`.

Please note that the "indirect" notation is not available in this mode.

## Creating a New Scene

Use `/scene <name>` to create a new scene. The bot will then create a new thread, prefixed with `ðŸŽ²`, where it will send dice logs. This thread will be named after the `scene`, and all other threads prefixed with `ðŸŽ²` will be archived.

The `tempo` argument allows you to create a "temporal bubble," which will create a thread prefixed with a clock icon, and by default, the channel name will be today's date.

## Help

Use `/help` to display the help message.
