# Rolling Dice

Use `/roll 1d20` to roll a die. You can also use "semi-direct" notation by adding a comment: `/roll 1d20 My comment`. Please note that "indirect" notation is not available in this mode.

# Creating a New Scene

Use `/scene <name>` to create a new scene. The bot will then create a new thread, prefixed with `ðŸŽ²`, where it will send the log. This thread will be named after the `scene`, and all other threads prefixed with `ðŸŽ²` will be archived.
